# Algoritmic-Search-Engine
This project is a mere simulation of how an actual search engine like Google works. They are obviously very fast because of the use of sophisticated functions and in built classes but at the heart of it or rather the algorithmic essence of it is represented by this project. It does not use a lot of inbuilt functions. The code may be very slow, after all it is not Google but the algorithm effectively represents the logic
